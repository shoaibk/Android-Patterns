#### Search and View Contact
This project starts where [SearchContacts](https://github.com/shoaibk/Android-Patterns/tree/master/Projects/SearchContacts) project ended.
User can search for a contact on the Search Widget, and pick one of the search suggestions. The name of the contact will then appear in a TextView of the activity.

##### Step 0 - Update Manifest
Add the following line in the <activity> tag
```xml
android:launchMode="singleTop"
```
