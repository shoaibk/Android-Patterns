#### Android-Patterns
This project contains a list of common Android programming patterns that arise frequently. 

It's not that there are not enough examples out there, but most of the time the referece implementations are not to the point, and try to do too many things at the same time.

The aim of this work is to handle each pattern at a time, independent of the others, as much as possible. I realize that sometimes it won't be just possible. For example, in order to implement a Content Provider, one needs to implement a database first.
